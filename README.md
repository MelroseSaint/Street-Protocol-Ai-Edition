Street Protocol: AI Edition is an open-world urban driving and exploration game built around autonomous city systems rather than scripted events. Set in a living city governed by traffic logic, pedestrian behavior, and adaptive law enforcement, every moment is shaped by how the city reacts to the player.

Players can freely move on foot or enter and exit a wide range of vehicles—including cars, vans, and trucks—at any time. Traffic flows dynamically, pedestrians follow real-world movement patterns, and police AI actively monitors violations, collisions, and reckless driving. Escalation is systemic, not staged.

The AI Edition introduces a fully reactive city: patrols respond to behavior, pedestrians adapt to danger, and traffic conditions evolve independently of player input. The city continues to operate whether the player intervenes or not, creating emergent situations and unpredictable outcomes.

Built with Three.js as a real-time simulation, Street Protocol: AI Edition prioritizes realism, freedom, and system-driven gameplay. The city is not a set piece—it is an active, persistent system.
